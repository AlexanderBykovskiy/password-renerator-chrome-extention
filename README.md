# Simple password generator

A simple application that shows how easy it is to create an extension for Google Chrome.

The extension generates a password based on the entered phrase.

The received password can be copied to the clipboard. Settings are stored in localeStorage.

To further dive into writing your own browser extensions, you should pay attention to storing data (for example, settings) in the user account (to synchronize settings on different devices) and interaction with the open page, tabs, etc.
